# Stastical Network Analysis in Python (SNAP)

## What does it do?
SNAP provides a statistical insight into your network through colorful graphs that make everyone
from C-level executives to your very own grandma impressed with you. Capture traffic from
your network using your favorite sniffer (make sure the file is in .pcap or .pcapng format)
and feed it to SNAP. SNAP then presents you with a list of options for you to extract and
export stastical goodies out of your .pcap. Choose as many options as you want!

## Installation
*Prerequisites* - You must have the following packages installed:
* [xmljson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmljson) - python package that converts xml to json
* [igraph](http://igraph.org/redirect.html) - python package with fantastic graphing capabilities
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) - python package that takes advantage of igraph and adds
even more graphing/statistical capabilities
* [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html) - network protocol analyzer

*Optional Packages* - You don't have to install these, but if you like taking up hard drive
space with programs you'll only use a couple times, then by golly install these bad boys:
* [jsbeautifier](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsbeautifier) - a python package that makes json
great again by converting unintelligible json files into ones readable by humans

Other than the prerequisites, download SNAP by using 
`git clone https://github.com/TRDan6577/networkStatistics.git`

### Reading installation instructions is lame and boring. Gimme the copy-pasta and leave the thinking to our robot overlords
`sudo pip install xmljson plotly igraph jsbeautifier && sudo apt-get install tshark && 
git clone https://github.com/TRDan6577/networkStatistics.git`

## How do I amaze others with this program?
Usage is simple: `./visualize <pacp file> [-retainJSON]`. The optional argument specifies whether or not
you want a human readable JSON file to be generated (if, for some reason, you want to view the
JSON file). By default, SNAP will delete the XML and JSON files it deletes but specifying 'y' as
the option argument forces SNAP to retain the JSON file. This JSON file is overwritten the next
time you specify 'y' as your optional argument. PLEASE NOTE MAKING THE FILE HUMAN READABLE CONSUMES
A HIGH AMOUNT OF SYSTEM RESOURCES AND A LOT OF TIME.

## What do the different options mean?
`1. Force graph of IP interactions` : This option creates nodes on a graph where each node is
a computer on the network and each edge connecting them indicates a transaction between computers.
Each node on the graph is colored according to the amount of packets it sent out. If node sent out
100% of the packets in the pcap, it will be solid red. On the other hand, if a node sends out only
one or two packets (resulting in nearly 0% of packets sent out), it will be colored solid blue. A
node that sends out about 50% of the traffic in the pcap will be colored purple. These colors are
a spectrum; this means if a node looks blueish purple, it sent out more traffic than a node colored
blue but less traffic than a node colored purple. The resulting graph is interactive. Hovering
over a node gives you its IP address, the left mouse button allows you to spin the graph, and the
right mouse button allows you to move the graph. Scrolling the wheel lets you zoom in and out.

`2. IP specific information (types of traffic, how much traffic, etc)` : This option shows the
statistical properties of a particular host on the network. Information provided includes:
amount of traffic sent and received, and types and amounts of traffic processed by the host 
(expressed in both bytes and number of packets). Currently, the types of traffic supported are
ICMP, ICMPv6, ARP, TCP, and UDP.

Additionally, this option also generates timelines for the traffic passed to and from that
IP address in terms of packets and bytes.

`3. General Information (For all IP addresses: types of traffic, how much traffic, etc)` : 
This option shows the same as the previous option, but rather than showing the statistics
about a single IP address that you give it, it shows statistics about all IP addresses in
the pcap. For this reason, this will not generate the 'Bytes sent/received' or 'packets 
sent/received' pie charts.

## Drawbacks
At this time, we have not found a good program that converts XML to JSON. Our current solution
does not play well with large XML files. This means that the pcap file that generates the XML
can not be large. The maximum pcap file size is dependant on the hardware you have available,
but as an example, a 700MB pcap file resulted in an XML file larger than 100GB. Any future
work done here should change start by changing the way we read the file (read the raw pcap
rather than converting it to a different file type)
